## Style Guide

- Use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) when naming variables and functions.
- Files begin and end with an empty line
- Use a functional programming style as much as possible
    - Except when needed for performance optimizations

Otherwise, follow Julia's official [style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#Use-naming-conventions-consistent-with-Julia-base/).
